-A summary of how I changed things using bootstrap for HW4: 
	I used bootstrap classes to format my navbar, resulting in a much cleaner and more visible bar. 
	I reformatted my entire page to match bootstrap's 12-column format and used floating containers 
	to create easily distinguishable blocks of content. I also changed the way images were being displayed 
	and added a jumbotron banner to the page. Bootstrap allowed me to remove a large amount of the css i was 
	using for styling and replace it with classes and div formatting.
